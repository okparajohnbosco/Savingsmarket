        <p>Savings rates have been steadily rising, right now hitting <br>the highest we've 
           seen for more than a decade.
        </p>
        <p>When searching for a savings account you'll want to find the<br> 
          highest interest rates. That way every penny is working hard to<br> give you the best returns possible.
          But with so many different <br>options
          available to UK savers it's not always an easy decision<br> to make.
        </p>
        <p>Whether you want to be able to access your money easily or<br> are keen to lock it away and forget 
          about it for a few years,<br> shop around and see how different savings accounts stack up <br>
          against each other.
        </p>
        <p>While times are tough, you'll probably want to make the most<br> of the best rates you're 
          eligible for, with an account that suits<br> how you want to access and run it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's estimated that 11.5 million UK adults have less than £100<br> in savings, according to the
          UK Strategy for Financial Wellbeing<br> 2020-2030 report published by the Money and Pensions Service<br>
          in January 2020, while nine million people borrow money to pay <br>
          their monthly bills. But it's not all bad news.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same report has set a target of creating a 'Nation of<br> Savers', increasing the number
          of monthly savers from 14.7m<br> to 16.7m by 2030. If you're someone who's already saving, 
          or<br> looking to take greater control of their financial future, you'll<br> want to be clever with your money 
          by putting it in the right<br> savings account. Here's our guide on how to avoid pitfalls and <br>
          compare savings account rates.

          <h2 class="what-is"><b><u>What</u> is a savings account? </b></h2>
          <div class="paragraph-bankaccount">
          <p>A savings account is a type of bank account<br> where you put money that you don't need to <br>spend immediately. 
            You deposit money with <br>the bank and get paid interest in return for <br>saving with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Savings accounts are simpler than current<br> accounts, which are designed for everyday<br> banking like paying bills.
             For example, you<br> can't have an overdraft with a savings account.<br> A savings account is there for you 
             to put<br> money away safely so it's available when you<br> need it. It can help you build up a lump sum, <br>
             and earn you interest on money that you don't<br> need right now, for other things.
