                        <p>Welcome to the Savings-Market.com website (“Site”). The following <br>Terms of Service (the “Terms”) 
                            govern your access to and use of the Site.<br> All use of the Online 
                            Platform and your comparison is subject to the <br>Terms. Additional terms incorporated into and 
                            made a part of these <br>Terms govern specific Services we or our affiliated entities may provide 
                            to<br> you, including Comparison Service (collectively, the “Services”).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By applying for a comparison or using the Online Platform, you <br>acknowledge that you have read,
                            understood and agree to comply with<br> the Terms. If you do not agree with anything contained in the Terms,<br> 
                            please do not submit 
                            information to, access information from or<br> otherwise utilise the Online Platform.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the Terms, users of this Online Platform and holders of comparisons <br>are sometimes referred to 
                            in the Terms as “you” or “your”. The applicable<br> operator of the Online Platform is trading as Savings-Market.com 
                            and is <br>referred to as “Savings Market”. Savings Market and the affiliated entities <br>may be referred to as “we”, “us” or “our”
                            in the Terms 
                            (as applicable). <br>Together, you and we may be collectively referred to as “Parties”.
                        </p>
                        <h4>1.2 Modification to the Terms of Service</h4>
                        <p>
                            We, and our affiliated entities, reserve the right to make changes to the<br> Terms at any time. 
                            It is your responsibility to review the Terms from time<br> to time to see if modifications have 
                            been made. Your continued use of <br>the Online Platform after any modification of the Terms will 
                            mean that<br> you accept those changes. Notwithstanding the above, we will seek to <br>notify
                            you of future modifications to the Terms to the extent that we are <br>required to do so by law.
                        </p>
                        <h4>1.3 Electronic Communication</h4>

                            electronic format,<br> then you may request the Communication in written form.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures<br> and other communications 
                            that we provide to you electronically satisfy <br>any legal requirement such Communications would satisfy 
                            if they were <br>provided in writing. With respect to these Terms, you waive any rights to<br> require an original

                            legal authorities and Savings Market or its <br>affiliated entities, in such investigation; (ii) complete any required<br>
